# Automatic-Bottle-Filling-System-
The project involved developing an **Automatic Bottle Filling System using a PLC** to automate the filling process for bottles on a conveyor belt. The system was designed to start and stop the process using push buttons, with a bottle detection sensor to identify the presence of bottles and control the filling operation. The conveyor belt transported bottles to the filling station, where a solenoid valve, controlled by the PLC, dispensed the liquid into the bottles. Timers were utilized to manage the duration of filling and the sequence of operations. An emergency stop feature was integrated into the system, ensuring safety by immediately halting the process when necessary. The ladder logic was carefully designed to ensure smooth, efficient, and reliable system performance.
